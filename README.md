Machine Learning Exercise to predict Avg. Daily Temperature for next 10 years.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit (1.14 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the six warmest years on record taking place since 2014. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight months out of that year — from January through September, except for June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.

This serves as a motivation to select this project. It is important to study the quantifiable weather parameters such as humidity, dewpoint, pressure to derive a relationship that helps determine the surface temperature. If this relationship can be defined by a model, it can be used to predict future temperatures over many years and thus can help prepare for climate change impacts and mitigate the crisis.
